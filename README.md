# PokeAI an RL pokemon battle simulator
  This Repository is a Pokemon AI Battle simulator that uses RL alorithms to create a universal Pokemon AI that is capable of making intellegent battle decisions. This project was made as a showcase to demonstrate the capibilities of RL algorithms for use in Pokemon Rom and Fan Games. There are 2 RL algorithms implemented: DQN and PPO. These were tested against a basic "highest damage move" style that is more similar to how a child plays for the first time. 


  This project couldn't have been done without the help of the [Pokemon-showdown repo](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown) which allows for the user to connect to pokemon showdown using a local server and simulate battles using bots. If you want to use thier code please go to thier repo as I have modified so of the code to run custom rulesets.
