  This Repository is a Pokemon AI Battle simulator that uses RL alorithms to create a universal Pokemon AI that is capable of making intellegent battle decisions. This project was made as a showcase to demonstrate the capibilities of RL algorithms for use in Pokemon Rom and Fan Games. There are 2 RL algorithms implemented: DQN and PPO. These were tested against a basic "highest damage move" style that is more similar to how a child plays for the first time.
